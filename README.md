## üìù Description

The IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate is a comprehensive, hands-on program covering:

- Machine learning with Python and Scikit-learn
- Deep learning with Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- Neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
- Generative AI (LLMs, Hugging Face, LangChain)
- NLP, computer vision, and real-world AI engineering projects

The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey, showcase my solutions and projects, and provide a transparent record of my progress.
